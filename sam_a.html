<p><strong>What ultimate players do you look up to and why?</strong></p>
<ol>
<p>
Too many to list, here's a few that stick out:
Dogs captains my freshman year:
Patrick Lahey: Freak athlete, never not dialed in on the field, weird off the field, and a perfect wingman
Nathan White: always thinking clearly, even in heated moments in big games
Eli Kerns: the game comes naturally to him, but he didn't settle for succeeding on natural talent alone, worked harder than anyone to reach his peak, always set the example for how to play the right way

David Hwang: student of the game, inspired me and others to dig deeper into how we should play
Orion Edwards: quietly a baller, always putting in extra effort to make the right play or to be a good teammate
Taylor Lahey: Has seen ultimate at its highest levels but knows the work it takes to get there
Kevin Cissna: we have consistently won games because of his tactical skill as a coach. More importantly, he has consistently brought the best out of players of all types, turning rookies into stars.
Beau: The best fucking player in the world.</p>
